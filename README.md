<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project started as a university project. At that time I was really on the React hype train and decided to go the MERN stack on this project. At some point while I was coding, I realized that having a web application for this purpose is pretty useless, unless it's a PWA. It would have been much better if I had decided to make a native mobile application... However it was too late to start over as I had a deadline and stuck with it.

Nevertheless, the server can be extracted and used with a different client. In the future maybe I will get back to this project and reimplement it as a mobile app.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
After launching the app the users sees a map of the region he is in. Depending on the browser they may need to allow location tracking and refresh the browser.
![Map](https://imgur.com/0pY61qX)

In order to make or accept orders users have to register.
![Register form](https://imgur.com/K0nPeIp)

After registering the users will be redirected to the main screen with the map. Double clicking on the map will set a point for his order. After confirming the point they can fill in the order form and create an order request.

This is the way the requester sees his order

The other users see other users' orders as potential deliveries.

If user accepts an order he has 20 minutes to complete the order.

The requester receives a real time update that his order has been accepted. 
![Requester sees order has been accepted](https://imgur.com/tZDzNHh)

After both the requester and the deliverer press the button that confirms that the order has been completed, the order is finished. The requester receives experience points and the deliverer receives the tips from the order.
